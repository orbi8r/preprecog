I read with some joy of the auspicious signs of the coming days, as they glimmer already through poetry and art, through philosophy and science, through church and state. One of these signs is the fact that the same movement which effected the elevation of what was called the lowest class in the state assumed in literature a very marked and as benign an aspect. Instead of the sublime and beautiful, the near, the low, the common, was explored and poetized. That which had been negligently trodden under foot by those who were harnessing and provisioning themselves for long journeys into far countries, is suddenly found to be richer than all foreign parts. The literature of the poor, the feelings of the child, the philosophy of the street, the meaning of household life, are the topics of the time."

All the mass has been treated, with more or less skill, by every playwright, and the prompter has the soiled and tattered manuscripts. It is now no longer possible to say who wrote them first. They have been the property of the Theater so long, and so many rising geniuses have enlarged or altered them, inserting a speech, or a whole scene, or adding a song, that no man can any longer claim copyright in this work of numbers."

The first of these views, advocated by Spinoza and held in our own day by Bradley and many other philosophers, is called monism; the second, advocated by Leibniz but not very common nowadays, is called monadism, because each of the isolated things is called a monad. Both these opposing philosophies, interesting as they are, result, in my opinion, from an undue attention to one sort of universals, namely the sort represented by adjectives and substantives rather than by verbs and prepositions. As a matter of fact, if any one were anxious to deny altogether that there are such things as universals, we should find that we cannot strictly prove that there are such entities as qualities, i.e."

I just TAKE my moral holidays; or else as a professional philosopher, I try to justify them by some other principle. If I could restrict my notion of the Absolute to its bare holiday-giving value, it wouldn't clash with my other truths. But we cannot easily thus restrict our hypotheses. They carry supernumerary features, and these it is that clash so. My disbelief in the Absolute means then disbelief in those other supernumerary features, for I fully believe in the legitimacy of taking moral holidays. You see by this what I meant when I called pragmatism a mediator and reconciler and said, borrowing the word from Papini, that he unstiffens our theories. She has in fact no prejudices whatever, no obstructive dogmas, no rigid canons of what shall count as proof."

What point of morals, of manners, of economy, of philosophy, of religion, of taste, of the conduct of life, has he not settled? What mystery has he not signified his knowledge of? What office, or function, or district of man's work, has he not remembered? What king has he not taught state, as Talma taught Napoleon? What maiden has not found him finer than her delicacy? What lover has he not out-loved? What sage has he not outseen? What gentleman has he not instructed in the rudeness of his behavior? 18. Some able and appreciating critics think no criticism on Shakspeare valuable, that does not rest purely on the dramatic merit; that he is falsely judged as poet and philosopher."

If anyone imagines that this law is lax, let him keep its commandment one day, says Emerson. We have heard much of late of the uses of the imagination in science. It is high time to urge the use of a little imagination in philosophy. The unwillingness of some of our critics to read any but the silliest of possible meanings into our statements is as discreditable to their imaginations as anything I know in recent philosophic history. Schiller says the true is that which 'works.' Thereupon he is treated as one who limits verification to the lowest material utilities."

Truth, for us, is not some pre-fabricated essence, antedating all experience and merely waiting for discovery. Rather, it is something that happens to an idea, something made by our interactions with the world. An idea becomes true, is made true, by events. Its verity is verified by its capacity to lead us fruitfully from one part of experience to another, to simplify, to organize, to predict, to satisfy our practical needs and intellectual curiosities alike. To say an idea is true is to say that it has 'cash-value' in the currency of experience; it pays dividends in the form of successful adjustment, of fruitful living, of mastery over the otherwise recalcitrant flow of sensations. It is a process, an ongoing validation, a ceaseless testing and re-testing against the resistant stuff of the world."

And let no man imagine that this self-reliance in conduct is an invitation to license or caprice. Quite the contrary. To trust one's self is to trust that divine particle which animates all selves, and which, by its very nature, is ever tending toward truth, beauty, and goodness. It is not the ego, with its petty desires and fears, that is to be obeyed, but the larger, impersonal Soul, which sees beyond the immediate and embraces the eternal. When a man is truly self-reliant in his ethics, his actions cease to be merely personal and become universal, reflecting the immutable laws of the spirit. His life becomes a poem, his every step a symbol of the divine order. Thus, let us cast off the suffocating garments of inherited virtue and the cramped confines of conventional morality."

But if, on the other hand, the future is genuinely open, if our choices matter, if the world is still in the making and we are its co-creators, then this belief invigorates our moral sensibilities and lends a dignity to our personal exertions. The truth of one proposition over the other, from a pragmatic standpoint, is not to be found in some abstract proof derived from logic, but in which conception yields the richer, more efficacious, and more morally satisfying consequences for a living being in a living world. This pluralistic and experimental temperament is, to my mind, the very essence of a pragmatic General Philosophy. It eschews the ambition of constructing a single, monolithic 'block universe' wherein all things are eternally fixed and interconnected by some grand logical necessity."

Again, the pragmatic method bids us look to the concrete particulars, to the immediate, felt experience. Reality, for us, is simply the sum total of all that we encounter, all that we must reckon with. It is the buzzing, blooming confusion of sensations, the manifold relations between things, the stream of consciousness, the resisting objects of the outer world, the thoughts and beliefs of our fellows, and even the products of our own imagination and will. It is the 'what-is' in its raw and irreducible facticity, the plenum of concrete experiences wherein our truths must find their purchase. We do not 'make' reality in the sense that we conjure it from nothing, but we actively shape and interpret it through our attention, our interests, and the categories we apply."

As the river carves its channel by the simple necessity of flowing, so will the virtuous life create its own path through the thickets of circumstance. In the end, we are judged not by what we have acquired, but by what we have become.

But much of what we term knowledge pertains to generalities, to relations, and to unperceived entities. When we say we 'know' the table to be brown, we are performing an inference from various sense-data (visual, tactile) experienced over time and in various circumstances. This inference is never strictly demonstrative; it is, rather, a hypothesis, supported by its coherence with other experiences and its predictive utility. The belief in an external world, populated by objects that persist unperceived and cause our sense-data, is thus a postulation, albeit one profoundly ingrained in human thought and eminently practical. The mind, therefore, does not merely passively receive impressions; it actively structures, relates, and infers. From the fleeting stream of sense-data, it constructs a stable world of objects, space, and time. Knowledge, in its fuller sense, is rarely a simple act of acquaintance with a fact, but rather an intricate web of acquaintance with particulars and universals, interwoven with beliefs, judgments, and logical inferences."

The dualistic position, famously championed by Descartes, suggests an affirmative answer, positing mind as a non-extended, thinking substance (res cogitans) distinct from the extended, unthinking substance of the body (res extensa). This view, however, immediately raises the perplexing problem of interaction: how can a non-physical entity causally influence a physical one, and vice versa? The materialist, conversely, asserts that mind is entirely reducible to physical processes, that mental states are identical with neural states. This approach, whilst elegant in its parsimony, faces the formidable challenge of accounting for the subjective quality of experience, the 'what-it-is-likeness' of consciousness, which seems resistant to purely physical description. Perhaps a more neutral monism, positing a fundamental reality of which both mind and matter are aspects, offers a more promising avenue. However, for the purposes of this chapter, we shall proceed with a functional understanding of mind as that which is capable of apprehending, processing, and storing information, regardless of its ultimate ontological status."
