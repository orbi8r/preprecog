Seeking truth is a vital human task, not just a simple academic one; it's a moral rule to understand our reality and one's own place in this existence, and we can't ignore it. Don't accept false reality. For Søren Kierkegaard, truth isn't just facts, but a life fully lived, an authenticity within one's existence. He famously stated, “subjectivity is truth.” This means the most important truths are those a human person would stake their life on. This kind of existential truth comes when actions align with deep convictions, forming an internal reality. That's the real truth. This relentless pursuit of understanding truth and its reality defines us, the human story; it fuels science and art, underpins justice, and it's central to our human existence.
